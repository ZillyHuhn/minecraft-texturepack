# minecraft-texturepack
My view increasing texture pack. Less fire, rain, snow and bossbars and more view.

It keeps the defualt look of minecraft but decreases the amount of flames blocking the view while the player is burning.
It removes the wither healthbar and also the text "Wither" but only if it has not been renamed. Rain and snow are completley removed.

## installation

```
cd ~/.minecraft && rm -rf resourcepacks && git clone https://github.com/ZillyHuhn/minecraft-texturepack resourcepacks
```
